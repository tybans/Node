[MODULE SUMMARY]

  Dynamic Routing:
    You can pass dynamic path segments by adding a ":" to the Express router path
    The name you add after ":" is the name by which you can extract the data on req.params
    Optional(query) parameters can also be passed (?param=value&b=2) and extracted (req.query.myParam)

  More on Models:
    A cart model was added - it holds static methods only 
    You can interact between models (e.g. delete cart item if a product is deleted)
    Working with files for data storage is suboptimal for bigger amounts of data
