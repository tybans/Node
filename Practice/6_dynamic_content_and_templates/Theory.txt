-Render dynamic content in our views
-Understanding Templating Engines

Templating Engines
    EJS     ==> <p><%= name %></p>
            ==> Use normal HTML and plain JavaScript in your templates
            ==> EJS does not suport layout
                    (layout)- Some code block to reuse
            ==> Partial or include features
            ==> Instead of having one master layout, you have a couple of separated shared view parts which you can merge into the view
            ==> Since we are using EJS, we don't need to use layout folder

    Pug (Jade)  ==> p #{name}
                ==> Use minimal HTML and custom template language

    Handlebars  ==> <p>{{name}}</p>
                ==> Use normal HTML and custom template language
                ==> npm install --save express-handlebars@3.0

    npm install --save ejs pug express-handlebars
