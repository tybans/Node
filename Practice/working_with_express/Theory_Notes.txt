Express
    - Server Logic is complex
    - Use a framework for the heavy lifting!
        Framework:- Helper functions, tools & rules that help you build your application
    - Install another package that can easily be hooked into our project that will then do the parsing
    - Express.js, we use it as a production dependency ==> npm install --save express

Express Middleware
    - Express.js is all about middleware
    - Middleware means that an incoming request is automaticlly funneled through a bunch of functions by express.js. So instead of having one request handler, you will actually have a possibility of hooking in multiple functions which the request will go through until you send a response.
    - This allows to split the code into multiple blocks or pieces instead of having one huge function

    - app.use(): A Middleware
        - It allows us to add a new middleware function, it is pretty flexible.
        - It accepts an array of request handlers, and it has some other use cases too



Middleware
The function which we pass to app.use() will be executed for every incoming request and this function will receive three arguments.

next is actually a function. A function that will be passed to this function by express.js
This next argument as a function has to be executed to allow the request to travel on to the next middleware
We have to call next() at the top middleware to allow the request to travel on to the next middleware in line. Basically it goes from top to bottom

app.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log('In the middleware');
    next()  // Allows the rquest to continue to the next middleware in Line
    
} )
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log('In another middleware');
    res.send('<h1>Hello from Express</h1')   //Send allows us to send a response, allows us to attach a body which is of type any
    
} )

Serve files Statically
    Not handled by the express router or other middleware but instead directly forwarded to the file system
    app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')))
    To access the static files, a folder which you want to grant a read access to
