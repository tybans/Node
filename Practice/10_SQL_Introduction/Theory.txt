SQL vs NoSQL
  Goal: Store data and make it easily accessible. It has quicker access than with a file
  Use a database: SQL database(e.g. MySQL) or NoSQL database(e.g. MongoDB)


What is SQL (Structured Query Language)
  - SQL thinks in tables.
  - Allow to relate different tables
  - Strong Data Schema
  - Data Relations: One to One, One to Many, Many to Many
  - Data is distributed across multiple tables
  - Horizontal Scaling is difficult/impossible; Vertical Scaling is possible
  - Limitations for lots of (thousands) read & write queries per second

SQL Queries
  SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 28



NoSQL
  - Database --> Collections --> Documents --> JavaScript Object
  - Schema-less
  - Data is typically merged / nested in a few collections
  - No Relations instead we go for duplicate data
  - Both Horizontal and Vertical Scaling is possible
  - Great performance for mass read & write requests


Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling

  Horizontal:
    We add more servers infintely and connect them to our database and split our data across all these servers

  
  Vertical: 
    We make our existing server stronger by adding more CPU or memory, but have some limit
